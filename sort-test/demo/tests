exec: numbers          sort numbers
This variant of the sort command treats the input as text strings that will
be sorted in dictionary/lexicographic order.  So anything that starts with
0 will come before anything that starts with a 1.

exec: numbers-numeric  sort -n numbers
By adding the -n command line option, we specify that the input should be
treated (and hence sorted) as a list of numbers, so 007 will come before
10, but not before 1.
